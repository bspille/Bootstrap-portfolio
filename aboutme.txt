I am a master of learning. From the early age of 2 my father impressed upon me the importance of learning how to learn. This philosophy did not mean that I had to learn any particular thing but the act of forming questions and seeking answers. As I progressed I not only learned how to learn but also apply what I have learned. I take pleasure in listening in on other peoples stories searching for bits of information that I can process. I spend a lot of time reading through technical information and watching videos when I have a project I am working on. I have a familiarity with tools of all types and I have spent many hours learning to work with my hands. I have managed to bridge the gap between being bookish and hands on that most people can't fathom. It is hard to present to employers my skill sets and abilities. My tales and claims are like out of a fantasy novel completely unbelievable.

From the point of view of a technician I am turning to the dark side of the work force that dwell in the mystical realm of computers. As I start my venture into this unfamiliar realm I liken my self to a space pirate learning to steal new techniques to matrix as my own and incorporate some of my own philosophies. I am voyaging into the darkness trying to navigate the terminal while learning new languages. I hope to find new and profitable ventures as a profiteer.
